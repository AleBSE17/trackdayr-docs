# Official TrackDayR Documentation Repository

## Create, place and name the file

All documentation file are in `Markdown` format (.md).  
These files are placed insides folders organized by argument.  
The naming of the files must be a single word in lowercase, the only exception is acronyms.  

## How to structure the file

The file must start with a title using this format: `# Heading level 1`  
Then you have to add a table of content (TOC) writing this placeholder: `[TOC]`.
It is important to not leave spaces around the placeholder.  
After you can start writing the content. It is good practice to structure the content with headings as they
will be referenced by the TOC and will be easily accessible.

## Example

```md
# Title

[TOC]

## Argument 1

Content 1  
Content 1  
Content 1  

## Argument 2

Content 2  
Content 2  
Content 2  
```
